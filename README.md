# moorea

Moorea is a flexible, simple and powerfull **graph** and mathematical **library** in Java.
It aims at making life easier by making code more **readable** and **reusable**.

The two killer features of the library are:
- Simple to use, understand, extend and distribute graph **design**
- Extremly reusable algorithms thanks to reification of **algebrical** objects: Monoid, Operator and **Semiring**

On top of that it provides also:

**on the graph side**
- several kind of **graph representation**:
 - adjacency list, edge list, matrix
- several kind of already implemented graph:
 -undirected, directed, weighted, spatial
- several general purpose graphs:
 - so called ContainerGraph, LabelledGraph and UniversalGraph
- several **graph generation** algorithms:
 - usual: ring, star, tree, grid, hypercube, regular ring latice, complete, complete bipartite
 - fancy: Watts-Strogatz, Erdos-Renyi, scale-free, hierarchical
- a few graph algorithms:
 - traversal, spanning tree, two pair shortest paths, all-pair shortest paths, connected components
- a few graph measures:
 - height, diameter
- a few graph output format:
 - dot, gephi, adjacency list
- and a clean interface to implement your own graph generation, iteration and manipulation algorithms

**on the math side**
- representation of **mathematical objects**: variable, scope, function
- **hypermatrix** representation package
- functionnal programming primitives
- random number generation helpers

**on the misc side**
- **Tupples** because they makes life sensibly easier
- Bidirectionnal maps
- Logging primitives (super easy file logging)
- Benchmarking primitives
